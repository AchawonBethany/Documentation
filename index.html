                    <article>
                        <p>Creative writing is a form of writing where creativity is at the forefront of its purpose through using imagination, creativity, and innovation in order to tell a story through strong written visuals with an emotional impact, like in poetry writing, short story writing, novel writing, and more.</p>

                        <p>Creative writing uses senses and emotions in order to create a strong visual in the reader’s mind whereas other forms of writing typically only leave the reader with facts and information instead of emotional intrigue. </p>
                        <p>Here are examples of creative writing:</p>
                        <li>Novels</li>
                        <li>Short Stories</li>
                        <li>Poetry</li>
                        <li>PLays</li>
                        <li>Songs</li>

                    <header id="">What are elements of creative writing?</header>
                    <article>
                        
                        <p> Here are the elements that make up creative writing and why each is just as important as the other. </p>

                        <li> Unique Plot
                             What differentiates creative writing and other forms of writing the most is the fact that the former always has a plot of some sort – and a unique one. Without having a plot, there’s no story. And without a story, you’re really just writing facts on paper, much like a journalist.</li><br>

                        <li>Character development
                            Character development can be defined as the uncovering of who a character is and how they change throughout the duration of your story. From start to end, readers should be able to understand your main characters deeply. </li><br>

                        <li>Underlying theme
                            Almost every story out there has an underlying theme or message – even if the author didn’t necessarily intend for it to. But creative writing needs that theme or message in order to be complete. That’s part of the beauty of this form of art. By telling a story, you can also teach lessons.</li><br>
                        <li>Visual descriptions
                            Visual descriptions are largely saved for creative writing. You need them in order to help the reader understand what the surroundings of the characters look like. This pulls readers in and allows them to imagine themselves in the characters’ shoes – which is the reason people read.
                            </li><br>
                        <li>Point of view
                            There are a few points of views you can write in. That being said, the two that are most common in creative writing are first person and third person.</li><br>

                        <li>Dialogue and Imaginative language</li>
                            Your characters should interact with one another in order to further the plot and development each other more. Part of what makes creative writing creative is the way you choose to craft the vision in your mind. And that means creative writing uses more anecdotes, metaphors, similes, figures of speech, and other comparisons in order to paint a vivid image in the reader’s mind.</li><br>

                    <header>Format of a story</header>
                    <article>
                    <p>  While there is no given format as such for story writing, there is a basic structure one can follow. It helps construct a story in an understandable manner and keeps the flow of the story. </p>

                    <li>Beginning: The beginning or the introduction of a story is of essential importance. This is the part where you can hook the reader and capture their attention. You must have come across some often used beginnings to stories like, “Once upon a time” or “A long time ago”. However, you can get more creative and begin your story with intrigue.</li><br>

                    <li>Character Introduction: Your story will depend heavily on how well you write your characters. To develop your characters, you can use dialogues as well. But you want to keep the dialogues limited in the shorter format. Also, do not include unnecessary secondary characters, every character of the story must have a purpose. </li><br>

                    <li>Plot: Here is where the actual narration of the story will happen. The events that occur or the description of the situation will be written in the plot. A plot must always have a conflict, which is the focus of any story. </li><br>

                    <li>Climax/Conclusion: And this is where the story will come to its logical conclusion. If there is a plot twist, this is where you will include it. Always end your story in an interesting manner. Also, it is not necessary to give your story a definite ending. A cliffhanger is another effective tactic.</li><br>

                    <header>How to get started</header>
                    <p>Many people think that just because they’ve read a lot of stories (or even if they haven’t!) they should be able to write one. 
            
                    <p>But as Nigel Watts writes:</p>

                    <p>There is a common belief that because most of us are literate and fluent, there is no need to serve an apprenticeship if we want to become a successful wordsmith. … That’s what I thought until I tried to write my first novel. I soon learnt that a novel, like a piece of furniture, has its own set of requirements, laws of construction that have to be learnt. Just because I had read plenty of novels didn’t mean I could write one, any more than I could make a chair because I had sat on enough of them. <p>

                    <p>(Nigel Watts, Teach Yourself Writing a Novel)</p>

                    By all means, if you’re keen, jump straight in and have a go: but don’t be too disappointed if your first efforts aren’t as good as you’d hoped. To extend Watts’ metaphor, you may find that these early attempts have wonky legs and an unsteady seat. And if you end up chewing your pen and staring at a sheet of paper, or gazing at a blank screen for hours, try kickstarting your writing with a short exercise. Don’t stop to think too much about it … just get going, without worrying about the quality of the work you produce.

                    <header>Some points to keep in mind</header>
                    <p> Make sure you give your story an exciting and appropriate title. A title is the first impression you made on the reader. Make sure that the facts you include in your story are accurate. You can take creative license while writing your story, but do not change universally accepted truths and facts. The story must flow fluently. If there is a series of events taking place, make sure the flow has some order. The reader must not be confused. Do not use very flowery language or overuse complicated words. The best stories are written in uncomplicated verse, so as not to distract from the plot. </p>
